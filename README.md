Assignment 3
```

I wrote a small Genetic Algorithm library, and used it to solve the two-agent traveling salesman problem.
The library is contained in `GeneticAlgorithms` and `GeneticAlgorithms.UnitTests`.
The assignment is in `Application` and `PerformanceGraphing`.

My project structure was heavily influenced by [GeneticSharp](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp).
